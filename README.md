# From 'Vibe-Code' Prototype to Production-Ready SaaS UI
### An open-source study in high-converting React components.
</div>

## The Narrative
I spent 4 hours "vibe coding" a SaaS UI in Google AI Studio. It looked like a $100M unicorn in 10 minutes, but under the hood, it was a mess of nested divs. 

**This repo is the result of the rebuild.** 

I took the "vibe" and engineered it into production-ready code, applying a 7-step conversion framework used by high-revenue SaaS businesses.

## What’s Inside (Current: Onboarding Flow)
This repo contains a high-converting **Onboarding Component** built with:
- **React + Tailwind CSS** (Clean, atomic structure)
- **Framer Motion** (For that "Apple Store" polish)
- **Zod Validation** (Because production apps need real data handling)
- **Conversion Psychology** (No distractions, single-focused CTA)

---

## Roadmap: The "Ultimate SaaS UI Kit"
I am currently engineering the rest of the SaaS kit. These components will be added here as free open-source samples, or as part of the full **$30 UI Starter Kit**:

- [x] **Onboarding Flow** (Available Now)
- [ ] **High-Conversion Pricing Page** (Coming Soon)
- [ ] **The "Apple-Style" Landing Page** (In Progress)
- [ ] **Full SaaS Dashboard & Auth UI** (Final Release)

**Want the full $30 kit (Dashboard, Settings, Billing, etc.)?**
I’m dropping the full Gumroad link next week.
